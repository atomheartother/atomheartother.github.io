  On 23rd and 24th of January, our CTF team, **InnovHacktion**, got to participate in FIC 2017, the biggest cybersecurity conference in France. We registered to the two challenges, one organized by [ACISSI](http://www.acissi.net/) and another organized by [EPITA](http://www.epita.fr/).

  Despite our very young team (20 years old on average!), we managed to place respectably at both challenges, both times in the top half of participating teams. It was a neat experience, we got to represent Epitech and had fun taking on the challenges. We'll be training for next year.

Our results:<br>
**First day**: ACISSI challenge - 17e / 40 teams<br>
**Second day**: EPITA challenge - 29e / 75 teams
